Project:
    Ideas:
        Have the cards all pull from a database instead of being hard coded. That way adding new card is easy and repeatable. Plus it makes the code more DRY.
    CSS:
        ✔ Mobile styling  @created(20-06-10 16:39) @done(20-06-18 13:21)
        The mobile break points make for a bad experince on mobile/smaller screens
        I did this for all the pages with cards and on the nav bar (see notion for notes on how I did this)
    Miscellaneous:
        ☐ Fix the wording on the "Setting a DC Card", its the same and the armor class card. @created(20-06-18 14:41)
    
    NPC Gen:
        ☐ Redo the entire way the npc names are picked/chosen @created(20-06-18 18:57)
        ☐ Remove the console.logs from the page @created(20-06-18 15:58)
        Unnessesary console.logs are still in production
        ☐ Add additional NPC names/quirks @created(20-06-10 16:41)
        Maybe add backstories and stats?


Bugs:
    ☐ Cannot search for spells in Upper case@created(20-06-18 18:58)
    ✔ After updating the navbar for mobile (adding the sidenav) the drop downs on the navbar no longer work. @created(20-06-18 13:48) @done(20-06-18 14:39)
    The short term solution is that I need to create an additional dropdown <ul> for the side nav. Navs in materialize cannot share the same dropdown target
