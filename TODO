Project:
    ☐ Add additional NPC names/quirks @created(20-06-10 16:41)
    Maybe add backstories and stats?s
    ✔ Mobile styling  @created(20-06-10 16:39) @done(20-06-18 13:21)
    The mobile break points make for a bad experince on mobile/smaller screens
    I did this for all the pages with cards and on the nav bar (see notion for notes on how I did this)

Bugs:
    ✔ After updating the navbar for mobile (adding the sidenav) the drop downs on the navbar no longer work. @created(20-06-18 13:48) @done(20-06-18 14:39)
    The short term solution is that I need to create an additional dropdown <ul> for the side nav. Navs in materialize cannot share the same dropdown target
